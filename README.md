# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
An iOS app to analyze twitter sentiment for a user entered text (twitter handle, name or stock symbol). This app checks the latest 100 tweets and using NLP generates a score that is represented by an Emoji. 

This app makes use of a model that I trained using CoreML and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
